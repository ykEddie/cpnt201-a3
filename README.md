### Additional Info

Using tailwind itself is pretty easy and quite fun once I actually figured out what I was doing. I think the way it's set up to be used is very simple and efficient and somewhat easy to learn.

However, setting everything up proved to be a big hassle even though I had initially set it up in class.
- When doing the build command `npx tailwindcss...` it kept coming back with an error telling me that the tailwind css file did not exist.
- I followed the recording and I did everything the exact same but it still kept messing up
- I realized that I kept forgetting to put the `./` before the `assets/css...` but then it said I was missing something in the content section of my tailwind css configuration
  - Realized I forgot the asterisk and it worked once I fixed it (but it literally took me 3 hours to solve it which really annoyed me lol)

What I understand a CSS framework to be is pretty much a bunch of stylesheets that are made beforehand and prepped so that once everything is set up they're ready to use right away. I think it's an effiency thing where it allows for less bugs and errors since they're compatible with multiple browsers.
